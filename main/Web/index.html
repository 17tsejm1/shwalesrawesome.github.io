I like cake and cake is awesome.  Did you know that cake is the best food in the world?  Cake is full of sugar which makes you super duper crazy!<br>
 Now, out of this silly mood.  Have you ever seen a unicorn?  The first written sighting of one was in the fourth century.  The greek doctor who sighted it described it as a wild horse with one horn.  Now just so you know... <b>UNICORNS ARE AWESOME</b><br>
 <b>How to be awesome:</b> <br>
 1. Be yourself <br>
 2. Follow step one <br>
 3. Follow step two <br>
 4. Be nice <br>
 5. Try to avoid eating people<br>
