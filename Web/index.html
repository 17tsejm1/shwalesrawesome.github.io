I like cake and cake is awesome.  Did you know that cake is the best food in the world?  However, some people can't have cake.  Some people have to try to live on less than<b> $1 </b>a day.  Because of this we need to raise awareness and help these people in grave poverty.  Did you know that if you have a bed, fridge, closet, and house you are richer than<i><b> 75%</b></i> of the population? <br>
 If you have ever seen an image of an African child they would have had large bellies.  You might see this as a symptom of eating to much but really it is because they are so malnourished that they developed kwashiorkor.  Kwashiorkor means that you are gravely malnourished and it makes your belly swell up. <br>
 Now, out of this depressing mood.  Have you ever seen a unicorn?  The first written sighting of one was in the fourth century.  The greek doctor who sighted it described it as a wild horse with one horn.  Now just so you know... UNICORNS ARE AWESOME
